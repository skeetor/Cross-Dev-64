# CrossDev64 - A C64/65xx cross-development IDE

CrossDev64 is an IDE for C64 assembler-coding on Windows, Linux other OSs running Java.
CrossDev64 offers a modern IDE inspired by popular frameworks i.e. like Visual Studio from Microsoft.

Java 7 or higher is required to run CrossDev64.  

This editor works together with common cross assemblers. Currently supported assemblers are 64tass, ACME, ca65, DASM, DreamAss, Kick Assembler and TMPx. Other assemblers might work as well, but syntax highlighting may not be 100% correct.
